# AI-Assisted Development Log

## Overview

This project was developed using **Claude Code** (Anthropic's AI coding assistant) in an interactive, iterative session. This document provides transparency about the AI's role in the development process.

## Development Methodology

### Human-AI Collaboration Model

**Human Role (Shane Weisz):**
- Defined project goals and requirements
- Provided domain expertise on IUCN Red List assessments
- Made architectural decisions
- Reviewed and approved AI suggestions
- Tested the pipeline with real data

**AI Role (Claude Code - Sonnet 4.5):**
- Researched IUCN Red List processes and standards
- Designed multi-agent architecture
- Implemented code and documentation
- Suggested best practices and error handling
- Generated comprehensive documentation

### Session Timeline

**Session Date:** October 20, 2025
**Total Duration:** ~2 hours
**Model Used:** Claude Sonnet 4.5 (claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929)

## Development Process

### Phase 1: Research & Understanding (30 min)
**Objective:** Understand IUCN Red List assessment process

**AI Tasks:**
1. Web search for IUCN Red List documentation and APIs
2. Analyzed assessment criteria (A-E) and thresholds
3. Researched existing automation tools (sRedList, etc.)
4. Examined data structure and API examples

**Human Input:**
- Initial goal: "Help me contribute a new IUCN red list assessment for a new species"
- Clarification: Want to understand the process for AI automation potential

**Outputs:**
- `SAMPLE_ASSESSMENT_DATA.md` - Data structure reference
- `example_assessment.json` - Atlantic Puffin reference assessment
- Initial `README.md` with assessment overview

**Tools Used:**
- WebSearch - IUCN documentation, API specs, research papers
- WebFetch - Attempted (auth issues, fell back to search)

### Phase 2: Architecture Design (30 min)
**Objective:** Design agentic workflow for end-to-end automation

**AI Tasks:**
1. Researched Claude Code subagent capabilities
2. Designed 12-agent pipeline across 5 phases
3. Defined data flow and communication protocols
4. Specified input/output formats for each agent

**Human Input:**
- Request: "Set up an agentic workflow... replicate panthera leo assessment end-to-end"
- Requirement: Pipeline should be reusable for any species

**Outputs:**
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Complete system design (514 lines)
- `STRUCTURE.md` - Project organization
- Directory structure created

**Design Decisions Made by AI:**
- File-based communication between agents (vs in-memory)
- Confidence scoring for each agent
- Isolated context per subagent
- Phase-based execution (parallel where possible)

**Design Decisions Made by Human:**
- Approval of multi-agent approach
- Goal: Replicate Panthera leo specifically

### Phase 3: Implementation (45 min)
**Objective:** Implement functional MVP (Phases 1-2)

#### 3a. Agent Definitions

**AI Created:**
1. `.claude/agents/taxonomy.md` - GBIF/IUCN API integration
2. `.claude/agents/occurrence.md` - Occurrence data collection
3. `.claude/agents/geographic.md` - EOO/AOO calculations
4. `.claude/commands/assess.md` - Orchestrator

**Key Implementation Details:**
- Each agent has clear input/output spec
- Error handling and fallback strategies
- Confidence scoring methodology
- IUCN standard compliance

#### 3b. Utility Scripts

**AI Created:**
1. `scripts/calculate_eoo_aoo.py` - Geographic calculations
   - GeoPandas for spatial operations
   - Minimum convex polygon for EOO
   - 2×2 km grid for AOO
   - Criterion B threshold evaluation

2. `scripts/setup.sh` - Automated environment setup
   - Virtual environment creation
   - Dependency installation
   - Directory structure
   - API key template

3. `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
4. `.gitignore` - Version control exclusions

**Human Input:**
- Approved GeoPandas approach over R's ConR package
- Confirmed Python as primary language

#### 3c. Documentation

**AI Created (all autonomous):**
1. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical design doc
2. `GETTING_STARTED.md` - User guide
3. `PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - Status and roadmap
4. `README.md` - Project overview
5. `STRUCTURE.md` - File organization

**Documentation Philosophy:**
- Comprehensive for reproducibility
- Multiple entry points (quick start, detailed guide, reference)
- Clear distinction between implemented vs planned features

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation (15 min)
**Objective:** Validate pipeline with Panthera leo

**AI Tasks:**
1. Invoked Taxonomy Agent - Retrieved species data from GBIF/IUCN
2. Invoked Occurrence Agent - Collected 16,353 records from GBIF
3. Fixed coordinate format bug (lat/lon vs latitude/longitude)
4. Ran geographic calculations
5. Generated results documentation

**Human Input:**
- Approved test execution
- Confirmed results made sense

**Outputs:**
- `data/panthera_leo/01_taxonomic_data.json`
- `data/panthera_leo/02_occurrence_data.json`
- `data/panthera_leo/03_range_metrics.json`
- `PANTHERA_LEO_RESULTS.md` - Complete test report

**Issues Found & Resolved:**
1. **Coordinate format mismatch:** Script expected `lat`/`lon` but data had `latitude`/`longitude`
   - **Fix:** Updated script to handle both formats
2. **Module not found:** GeoPandas not installed
   - **Fix:** Ran setup.sh to install dependencies

### Phase 5: Version Control (5 min)
**Objective:** Initialize git repo and commit

**AI Tasks:**
1. Created `.gitignore` - Excluded API keys, venv
2. Initialized git repository
3. Staged all files (excluded sensitive data)
4. Generated comprehensive commit message
5. Pushed to GitHub using `gh` CLI

**Human Input:**
- Request: "Commit this"
- Request: "Push this to a new github repo"
- Approval of each git operation

**Outputs:**
- Git repository with clean history
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/shaneweisz/ai-redlist-assessments

## AI Decision-Making Process

### When AI Made Autonomous Decisions

**Architecture:**
- Choice of file-based vs in-memory communication → File-based (better for debugging)
- Number of agents (12) and phase structure (5) → Based on IUCN workflow analysis
- Confidence scoring system → Industry best practice for AI systems

**Implementation:**
- Python + GeoPandas → Standard for geospatial analysis
- JSON for data exchange → Structured, human-readable
- Subagent architecture → Leveraging Claude Code capabilities

**Documentation:**
- Structure and organization → Multiple entry points for different users
- Level of detail → Comprehensive for reproducibility
- Examples and references → Based on IUCN official docs

### When Human Made Key Decisions

**Project Scope:**
- Target: Replicate Panthera leo assessment
- Technology: Claude Code subagents
- Goal: Automation for conservation impact

**Validation:**
- Approval of test execution
- Acceptance of results
- Git operations (commit, push)

   git clone https://github.com/shaneweisz/ai-redlist-assessments.git
   ```

2. **Run setup:**
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

3. **Add API keys:**
   - Get IUCN API key from https://api.iucnredlist.org/users/sign_up
   - Add to `src/config/api_keys.env`

4. **Run assessment:**
   - Use Claude Code with Task tool to invoke agents
   - Or run Python scripts directly

## Transparency Considerations

### What the AI Knew
- IUCN Red List documentation (public)
- GBIF API documentation (public)
- Claude Code subagent capabilities
- Python geospatial libraries
- Git best practices

### What the AI Didn't Know
- Your specific research goals
- Internal IUCN processes beyond public docs
- Unpublished assessment data
- Domain expertise (relied on research)

### Limitations of AI Assistance

**AI Cannot:**
- Validate scientific accuracy without domain expertise
- Make conservation decisions
- Replace expert review
- Ensure data quality beyond automated checks

**AI Can:**
- Accelerate development
- Research and synthesize information
- Generate boilerplate code
- Suggest best practices
- Create comprehensive documentation

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Iterative approach:** Research → Design → Implement → Test
2. **Clear goal:** "Replicate Panthera leo assessment" was specific enough
3. **AI research phase:** Let AI gather context before designing
4. **Human validation:** Human reviewed and approved key decisions
5. **Documentation first:** Created docs alongside code

### What Could Be Improved
1. **Testing earlier:** Could have tested agent invocation sooner
2. **API key management:** Setup process could be smoother
3. **Data format validation:** Could have specified JSON schema upfront

### Advice for Similar Projects

**For Researchers:**
- Start with clear, specific goals
